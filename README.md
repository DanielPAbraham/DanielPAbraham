Hello, I'm Daniel A. Perez. I am a student in engineering and Full-Stack Developer with a passion for group projects, problem solving, and software development. I want to specialize in back-end development and learn about AR/VR programming; a newer field of programming that I feel will be very prevalent in the near future.

I enjoy building PC's and talking about PC components, especially when it comes to creating builds for PC gaming or workstations for animation/video editing. The world of tech has gone nuts with the explosion of crytpo-currency and the dependency for software to regulate data that keeps the world turning.
