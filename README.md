Hello, I’m Daniel A. Perez!

I’m an interdisciplinary engineering student at Florida International University focusing on Industrial Engineering and dedicated Full-Stack Developer with careful attention to detail and functionality. 

I have a passion for technology, creating efficient solutions for everyday problems, and working on group projects. 

I believe that the future of technology and software will be in dissolving the physical boundaries of the real world and that of the digital world. I have a few ideas and projects in the back burner for how I can implement solutions to bring a new standard to the digital age.
